    >
      <p>
        Through Northeastern University London's FinTech Society, I joined the
        Nexus Investment Fund as a Junior Analyst on a four-person team
        conducting equity research on Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET), a $52
        billion midstream energy infrastructure company operating over 125,000
        miles of pipeline across the U.S. Our team produced a full equity report
        and live investor pitch recommending a Long Buy position based on Energy
        Transfer's fee-based revenue model, scale advantages, and valuation
        discount relative to peers.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Each analyst team was tasked with identifying an undervalued investment
        opportunity and presenting defensible equity research to the fund's
        leadership. We had to evaluate Energy Transfer across financial health,
        competitive positioning, industry trends, and risk factors within a
        compressed timeline designed to simulate real investment research
        conditions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">My Contributions</h2>
      <p>
        I owned the company overview and business model sections of the report,
        researching Energy Transfer's revenue streams, segment breakdown, core
        customer base, and geographic presence across U.S. producing basins. On
        the financial analysis side, I calculated accounts receivable turnover
        ratios for 2021-2024 to analyze collection efficiency trends, pulling
        data from Yahoo Finance and Energy Transfer's investor relations filings.
        I also delivered the company analysis and business model portions of our
        team's live investor pitch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the key findings that supported our Long Buy recommendation:
        Energy Transfer holds roughly 21% market share in U.S. gas pipeline
        transportation with dominant Permian Basin infrastructure, about 90% of
        its revenue comes from fee-based contracts that insulate the business
        from commodity price volatility, and its forward P/E of 10.76 compared
        to Kinder Morgan's 20.53 suggested meaningful undervaluation relative to
        peers. The company posted $82.67 billion in 2024 revenue with adjusted
        EBITDA growing from $13.0 billion to $15.5 billion over the 2021-2024
        period.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">What I Took Away</h2>
      <p>
        This was my first experience with equity valuation, and the biggest
        lesson was that no single metric tells the story — you have to examine
        financial ratios, competitive dynamics, industry trends, and macro
        conditions simultaneously to build a defensible thesis. The live pitch
        component taught me how to translate complex financial analysis into
        something clear and persuasive, balancing technical detail with
        accessibility for the audience. Working across a four-person team where
        each analyst owned a different section (company overview, industry
        analysis, valuation modeling, risk assessment) also showed me what it
        takes to integrate individual pieces into a cohesive deliverable.
