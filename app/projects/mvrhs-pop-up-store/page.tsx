      <p>
        During my senior year at Martha's Vineyard Regional High School, our
        business teacher Paul Angelico proposed the idea of running a student-led
        pop-up store during the Christmas in Edgartown festival — one of the
        island's busiest tourism weekends. I was one of four students who took the
        project from a September pitch to a fully operational retail store by
        December, managing vendor relationships, inventory sourcing, workforce
        recruitment, and community outreach. The store operated out of a donated
        Mad Martha's ice cream parlor on North Water Street, selling
        MVRHS-branded merchandise, CTE student-made products, and goods from
        over ten local business partners.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        We were building a retail operation from scratch with no sales track
        record, limited school funding, no paid workforce, and a compressed
        timeline. The school administration initially planned five weekends but
        scaled back to a single four-day pilot after concerns about inventory
        costs and financial risk. That meant we had to source products on
        consignment wherever possible, recruit volunteer workers, and still
        deliver a professional retail experience — all within tighter constraints
        than we originally planned for.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">My Role</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of my work was vendor outreach. I cold-emailed and called local
        businesses to establish partnerships, adapting the pitch to each one —
        Martha's Vineyard Glassworks had never sold outside their gallery and
        had concerns about product fragility, so I had to address those
        objections to close the deal. We negotiated a 50/50 profit-sharing
        arrangement for 100 hand-blown glass ornaments and I coordinated pickup,
        return logistics, and post-event invoicing. I also sourced Brazilian
        snacks and truffles from Vineyard Grocer on wholesale terms, recognizing
        that the island's large Brazilian community was an underserved customer
        segment. Product listings were translated into Portuguese for bilingual
        marketing materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond vendor work, I developed the operational planning documents
        covering store layout, decorations, product display, employee shifts, and
        point-of-sale procedures — documents that Mr. Angelico used to assign
        tasks across multiple business classes. When volunteer sign-ups were low,
        I coordinated directly with the National Honor Society advisor to
        distribute the sign-up sheet to NHS members, ultimately building a 30+
        person volunteer sales team. I also pitched strategic ideas that shaped
        how the store ran, including a silent auction for high-value Adirondack
        chairs built by the carpentry shop, a revenue-sharing model with Mad
        Martha's, and raffle promotions to drive foot traffic.

        The store carried three categories of products: MVRHS-branded
        merchandise like sports t-shirts and hoodies, CTE student-made goods
        including Adirondack chairs, automotive gift cards, chocolate truffles,
        and Christmas wreaths, and third-party vendor products from local
        businesses including Flat Point Farm, Island Bee Company, Chilmark
        Coffee, Monarch Studios, and others. I was also interviewed by the
        Vineyard Gazette and on MVY Radio to promote the store.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">What I Took Away</h2>
      <p>
        We broke even, which was a good outcome for a first-time operation with
        no historical sales data — if we had done it again, we would have been
        profitable. The experience taught me that every vendor has different
        constraints and you have to tailor the pitch accordingly. It also showed
        me that recruiting unpaid volunteers requires leveraging institutional
        channels like NHS service hours rather than relying on general
        announcements. Most importantly, actively including the Brazilian
        community through product selection and bilingual materials broadened
        both our customer base and the store's relevance to the full island
        population. Profits were returned to school departments including
        culinary, carpentry, and art.
